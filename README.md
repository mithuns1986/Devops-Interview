# Devops-Interview on Client Payment Centre Canada


### Introduction
Hi, I'm a DevOps Engineer with over 4 years of experience in designing, deploying, and managing cloud infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines. My expertise lies in AWS, Linux, Git, Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Tomcat, and Maven. Currently, I'm working on the Payments Centre Canada project, where I play a crucial role in automating and streamlining operations to ensure smooth and efficient deployments.

### Implementation of AWS and DevOps Services

#### AWS Services
1. **Designing and Deploying AWS Solutions**:
   - Utilized AWS services such as EC2, S3, Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), and auto-scaling groups to design and deploy scalable and reliable infrastructure.
   - Set up EC2 instances and configured prerequisites for deploying applications, ensuring optimal performance and security.

2. **Automation with CloudFormation/Terraform**:
   - Automated the build and deployment process using CloudFormation and Terraform, reducing manual work by 85%.
   - Created and managed infrastructure as code (IaC) to ensure consistency and repeatability in deployments.

#### DevOps Services
1. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**:
   - Configured Jenkins nodes and integrated Git with Jenkins to automate the build and deployment process.
   - Scheduled jobs using the POLL SCM option and set up the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process using Ansible, Jenkins, and Docker.

2. **Containerization and Orchestration**:
   - Built and managed Docker containers and images, ensuring efficient and consistent application deployment.
   - Utilized Kubernetes to manage Docker container clusters, creating and managing pods for scalability and stability.
   - Used Jenkins pipelines to drive microservices builds to the Docker registry and deployed them to Kubernetes.

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - Wrote tasks, handlers, playbooks, and roles using Ansible in YAML language to automate configuration management.
   - Maintained Git repositories, handled releases, and managed branching activities to ensure version control and collaboration.

4. **Troubleshooting and Support**:
   - Troubleshot and stabilized various build, deploy, and environment issues to ensure smooth operations.
   - Assisted developers with build, release, SCM, and build setup issues, providing support and guidance.

5. **Automation and Scripting**:
   - Automated manual processes by writing shell scripts and Python scripts, enhancing efficiency and reducing errors.
   - Developed microservice onboarding tools leveraging Python and Jenkins for easy creation and maintenance of build jobs and Kubernetes deployments.

By implementing these AWS and DevOps services, I was able to streamline operations, enhance scalability, and ensure efficient and reliable deployments for the Payments Centre Canada project.
